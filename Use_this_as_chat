I'm not sure what went wrong with the code I just uploaded. I thoroughly checked the loop
and I am confident that it runs in the proper order (from bottom to top diagonals, from left to right in diagonals)
and fetches the right elements as neighbours. The fact that it outputs garbage, to me, hints at wrong scalars in the
summation of the individual elements and rho.

I Updated the examples. Phi does seem more reasonable. Maybe the code is not wrong.
